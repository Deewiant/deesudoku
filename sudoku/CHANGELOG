     \------------------------------/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.1.1        2006-02-18
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Change: moved the "Solved!" output from showing the grid to the statistics.
 - Change: added a check for whether the puzzle is solved at every iteration.
           This is a significant optimisation, now that there are so many solve
           methods.
 - Internal: moved ++iterations from after calling the solve methods to before.
 - Internal: moved XY-wing so that it is tried before ichthyology. A minor speed
             increase results.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.1.0        2006-02-17
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - New feature: timer. Packaged in with the rest of the stats. Counts only the
                       time used in solving, not the total time taken.
 - New option: --no-solve.
 - New technique: XY-wing.
 - Bug fix: iterations were not zeroed at the beginning of solving.
 - Internal: added the handyish nCandidates() function.
 - Internal: moved output functions to a module of their own. Still lots of
             dout.writefln(), derr.writefln() elsewhere.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.0.0        2006-02-14
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Milestone: first numbered version!
 - Milestone: capabilities should now equal those of http://sudokusolver.co.uk/,
              but only in terms of "logic": no equivalent to its "Ariadne's
              Thread" bruteforcer.
 - New technique: Ichthyology (X-Wing, Swordfish, etc.).
 - New option: --help.
 - New option: --version.

 - New option: --total-statistics.
 - New option: --examples.
